Genes	393		GOBP_APOPTOTIC_PROCESS [1965]	A programmed cell death process which begins when a cell receives an internal (e.g. DNA damage) or external signal (e.g. an extracellular death ligand), and proceeds through a series of biochemical events (signaling pathway phase) which trigger an execution phase. The execution phase is the last step of an apoptotic process, and is typically characterized by rounding-up of the cell, retraction of pseudopodes, reduction of cellular volume (pyknosis), chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation (karyorrhexis), plasma membrane blebbing and fragmentation of the cell into apoptotic bodies. When the execution phase is completed, the cell has died. [GOC:cjm, GOC:dhl, GOC:ecd, GOC:go_curators, GOC:mtg_apoptosis, GOC:tb, ISBN:0198506732, PMID:18846107, PMID:21494263]	51		3.24 e-12	2.82 e-8		ELF2_TARGET_GENES [1512]	Genes containing one or more binding sites for UniProt:Q15723 (ELF2) in their promoter regions (TSS -1000,+100 bp) as identified by GTRD version 20.06 ChIP-seq harmonization.	59		3.58 e-22	3.99 e-19
Mapped	370		GOBP_VESICLE_MEDIATED_TRANSPORT [1541]	A cellular transport process in which transported substances are moved in membrane-bounded vesicles; transported substances are enclosed in the vesicle lumen or located in the vesicle membrane. The process begins with a step that directs a substance to the forming vesicle, and includes vesicle budding and coating. Vesicles are then targeted to, and fuse with, an acceptor membrane.

			GOCC_RIBOSOME [239]	An intracellular organelle, about 200 A in diameter, consisting of RNA and protein. It is the site of protein biosynthesis resulting from translation of messenger RNA (mRNA). It consists of two subunits, one large and one small, each containing only protein and RNA. Both the ribosome and its subunits are characterized by their sedimentation coefficients, expressed in Svedberg units (symbol: S). Hence, the prokaryotic ribosome (70S) comprises a large (50S) subunit and a small (30S) subunit, while the eukaryotic ribosome (80S) comprises a large (60S) subunit and a small (40S) subunit. Two sites on the ribosomal large subunit are involved in translation, namely the aminoacyl site (A site) and peptidyl site (P site). Ribosomes from prokaryotes, eukaryotes, mitochondria, and chloroplasts have characteristically distinct ribosomal proteins.
